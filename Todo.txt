testing
	stop word list file (manually run ... OK)
	
--dry_run
	does nothing but 

--silent option for --check command
--show_description associated with document
	how do we get the description there to start with

aliasing
	we want to keep the name of the container and its contents
	to avoid verifying all files, only yhe container
	
	=> better way is to hold extra information in the id_to_docs db
		- little impact on the interface
		- better information back to the user
	
	$files matching = $indexer->match_desription (qr//)
	
	search function should accept callback
	
	callback should tell if the current document information is to be added to the returned information
		=> we can same some memory and cpu time when the display is done through callback
		
move perl specific definitions to Search::Indexer::Language::Perl

removing document when positions == 0 should also remove the entries from the index
